        <ol>
            <li>His first Bollywood lead role came in 2005 with film Rog. His performance was praised by critics; one wrote, "Irfaan's eyes speak louder than his words and every time he is in frame, be it talking to his buddy Manish or arguing with Suhel, he shows his capability as an actor</li>
            <li>In 2004, he won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role in film Haasil.
                In 2007, he appeared in the box office hits Life in a... Metro, for which he received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award</li>
        </ol>
        </li>

        <li><p><strong>International Success</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Khan played a police inspector in the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire, for which he and the cast of the movie won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.</li>
            <li> His film, Paan Singh Tomar, about real-life athlete turned dacoit, for which he won the National Film Award for Best Actor</li>
            <li>In 2013, he starred in The Lunchbox, which won the Grand Rail d'Or at Cannes Film Festival and received a BAFTA nomination, and became his highest-grossing Hindi film up until then.</li>
